/// where each vector is sorted in ascending order of time.  In each vector, there may be no
/// adjacent records with the same timestamp.

/// The id is necessary to distinguish the different event streams for a single job.  Consider a run
/// of records from the same host.  There may be multiple records per job in that run, and they may
/// or may not also have the same cmd, and they may or may not have been rolled up.  There are two
/// cases:
///
/// - If the job is not rolled-up then we know that for a given pid there is only ever one record at
///   a given time.
///
/// - If the job is rolled-up then we know that for a given (job_id, cmd) pair there is only one
///   record, but job_id by itself is not enough to distinguish records, and there is no obvious
///   distinguishing pid value, as the set of rolled-up processes may change from invocation to
///   invocation of sonar.  We also know a rolled-up record has rolledup > 0.
///
/// Therefore, let the pid for a rolled-up record r be JOB_ID_TAG + r.job_id.  Then (pid, cmd) is
/// enough to distinguish a record always, though it is more complicated than necessary for
/// non-rolled-up jobs.

/// that there is not a clash with a pid, but it's possible job IDs can be larger than PIDS.
