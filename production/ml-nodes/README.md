# ML-nodes sonar and sonalyze setup

## Files

These are files that are used to drive sonar and the analysis of sonar
logs during production.

The work is driven by cron, so there are two crontabs:

- `jobanalyzer.cron` is a user crontab to run on each host other than
  ML4.  It just runs `sonar`.

- `jobanalyzer-ml4.cron` is a user crontab to run on ML4.  It runs
  `sonar` but also the analysis jobs (it runs on ML4 because nobody
  uses that node much).

The crontabs just run a bunch of shell scripts:

- `sonar.sh` is a script that runs sonar with a set of predetermined
  command line switches and with stdout piped to a predetermined
  location.

- `cpuhog.sh` and `bughunt.sh` are analysis jobs that process the sonar
  logs and look for jobs that either should not be on the ML nodes or
  are stuck and indicate system problems.

The analyses needs to know what the systems look like, so there are
files for that:

- `ml-nodes.json` describes the hardware of the ML nodes, its format
  is documented in `../../sonalyze/MANUAL.md`.

## Production

The typical case in production will be that all of these files are
manually copied into a directory shared among all the ML nodes, called
`$HOME/sonar`, for whatever user is running these jobs.  Also in that
directory must be binaries for `sonar` and `sonalyze`.

If your case is not typical you will need to edit the shell scripts
(to get the paths right and make any other adjustments).

`sonar` runs every 5 minutes and logs data in $HOME/sonar/data/, under
which there is a tree with a directory for each year, under that
directories for each month, and under each month directories for each
day.  Directories are created as necessary.  In each leaf directory
there are csv files named by hosts (eg, `ml8.hpc.uio.no.csv`),
containing the data logged by sonar on that host on that day.

The analysis jobs `cpuhog` and `bughunt` run every two hours now and
log data exactly as `sonar`, except that the per-day log files are
named `cpuhog.csv` and `bughunt.csv`.

(The analysis log files are then further postprocessed off-node by the
`naicreport` system; the latter also sometimes uses the raw logs to
produce reports.)
